# budget-app
A budgeting application with offline capabilities


# Purpose

This app was built to address an assigned user story:

```
AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

## Dependencies

This app requires the following npm packages: "compression", "express", "lite-server", "mongoose", "morgan". To install these packages, please run an "npm install" command.
